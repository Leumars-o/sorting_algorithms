Sorting Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of sorting algorithms implemented in C. Sorting algorithms are fundamental techniques used in computer science to arrange elements in a specific order. These implementations provide an opportunity to study and understand different sorting algorithms, their complexities, and their practical applications.

Sorting Algorithms Included
The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this repository:

Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort

Each algorithm is implemented as a separate C file, making it easy to study and compare different sorting techniques.
